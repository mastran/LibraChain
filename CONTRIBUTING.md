# Contributing to LibraChain

possible.

## Our Development Process

A TODO comment should include the number of an issue that describes the outstanding work in greater detail.

A pull request that is a work in progress that has been published to get help and feedback from the community should be tagged with WIP.

The person approving a pull request will also merge it into master.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Ensure the build passes.
3. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").
